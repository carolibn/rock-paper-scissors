# Simple Rock Paper Scissors Project
My first JavaScript project. It lets you play rock paper scissors against a computer by selecting the image corresponding to your move.

To play the game, copy the repo and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Alternatively, you can view the live deployment on GitHub Pages.
